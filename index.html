        <h3>About Fred</h3>
        <p class="line1">I have been training at the highly-regarded Mayden Academy in Bath. Already a Certified Scrum Master and proficient in HTML and CSS, I am enjoying myself immensely and look forward to gaining yet more skills in PHP and javascript to name but a few! I love finding creative solutions to problems and there is an enormous pleasure in learning new things.</p>

        <p class="line2">Beyond coding, I conduct orchestras professionally and have a deep love of classical music. I direct Resonance Orchestra in Bristol and the University of Bath Orchestra. My favourite gig to date was putting a 100-strong orchestra under Concorde at the Aerospace Museum to perform Shostakovich. 500 people came, of whom ~200 were under 30 years old which is practically unheard of in this genre!
        </p>

        <p class="line3">In my free time I enjoy riding my motorcycle, which I often do off-road. It is lovely to get out into the countryside and reconnect with nature, so occasionally I will take a tent or a hammock and have a weekend away from the city, out in the wilderness! Beyond that I enjoy cooking, climbing, playing with my niece and nephews and very occasionally doing absolutely nothing.</p>
